#Pseudocode

#start program

#prompt user to input age as an integer, assign to Age
#input if age is >= 55, then display: Senior
#input if age is >= 20 and <= 54, then display: Adult
#input if age is >= 13 and <= 19, then display : Teen
#input if age is <= 12, then display: Minor
#generate the required output

#Collaboration: none

#End Program
